grimmbox-rst
============
Grimmbox is a library built on top of [rustbox](https://github.com/gchp/rustbox)
for creating simple text-box based terminal user interfaces (TUIs)

It's very bare bones at the moment, currently handling text boxes and text
reflow. The example has a proof of concept on how to do selectable boxes.

For usage example, look at the sample application
[grimmtask](src/bin/grimmtask.rs)
